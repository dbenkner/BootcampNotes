Journey to Max
I had been interested in technology from a young age when I was 11 I had built a website using HTML and CSS. I took some courses on computer programming in high school but took a different direction in college and studied history and liberal arts. Post college worked some customer service jobs. In the back of my mind I had always wanted more, knew I had been good with technology and computers but always felt that was a dream to work in tech. I had taken a role as a technical support role at an ISP and that helped rekindle my passion for tech and I wanted to dig in and learn more. Through that job I also realized I wanted to do more than just diagnose or solve small issues but go on to solve bigger problems and build things. I did some reasearch on ways I can build up my career and gain the skills needed to pursue this. With this I found Max where I have recently completed a 13 week bootcamp building a fullstack program both the front end and the back end with this skillset I gained at Max along with my natural apptitude for technology and extnesive customer service background I'd make a valuable contributer to a team.
